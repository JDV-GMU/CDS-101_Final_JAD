## 1. Dataset

**Dataset Name:**  Diamonds.
**Source / Platform (Kaggle, UCI, gov, etc.):**  Kaggle

**Short Description:**  
- What does this dataset contain?  
It contains various physical features of diamonds as well as their prices.
- What are the main variables (features)?  
The Carat (weight) of each diamond, Cut quality grade, Color of each diamond, Clarity (internal flaw grade), Table (Width percentage), x, y, and z, for length, width, and depth in millimeters. And then the price per diamond.
- Approximate number of rows / columns?  
about 54 thousand entries and 10 columns
- Why is this dataset interesting or relevant?

## 4. Modeling Approach / Models Used

Describe what you plan to do analytically.

- Type of task (check all that apply):
  - [ ] Exploratory analysis only  
  - [.] Regression (predicting a numeric value)  
  - [ ] Classification (predicting categories/labels)  
  - [ ] Clustering / unsupervised patterns  
  - [ ] Other (describe)

**Planned models / methods:**

Linear regression

**Planned evaluation metrics:**

RMSE, MAE, \(R^2\)

## 5. Expected Results

What do you expect to find? It’s okay if this changes later.

- Bullet point 1 
- Bullet point 2  
- Bullet point 3
